<h1>2020</h1>
<p> It was a normal day. Suddenly, my mum comes up with the idea of me taking up piano lessons. I was only 5 years old and was very worried that piano would be very difficult for me. The next day, I had my first trial piano lesson. It turned out very well and my teacher said that I was a gifted pianist. From then on, I pursued my musical journey and continued lessons, growing and sharing my passion with others.</p>

    <h1>2021</h1>
    <p> This was the year when I was about to sit my first piano exam. It was the preparation test which helps me go to grade 1. we had applied and it was told to me that my exam would be the following month. I was extremely nervous and spent hours practising every day. However, the week before the exam my mum was told that there was an issue and that they didn't receive my application. This meant that I couldn't sit the test and go further in my piano journey. I was dishearted but also happy that I got to skip the exam. I was worried that I might not be able to continue sitting piano exams. </p>

        <h1>2022</h1>
        <p> A year later, my teacher helped me and guided me to continue playing music. We spoke with the examination board and they said that I could skip the prep test and go straight forward to grade 1. I was delighted that I could continue my exams. I sat my first grade exam and passed with distinction (the highest rank). </p>

            <h1>2023</h1>
            <p> By this time I was already on grade 3 and had passed all my previous exams along with other theory exams. However, just as I was about to start for grade 4, my teacher got very unwell so I was unable to go for lessons. Not only was I worried about my teacher, but I was also worried about the halt in my piano journey. Therefore I decided to teach myself and managed to pass the exam without any help. My teacher had retired so we had to find a new one. </p>

                <h1>2024</h1>
                <p> I had started lessons with a new teacher. However, she is very strict and it is taking a long time to become acquainted with her. However, she is related to one of the world's best pianists so I am tolerating her as she is teaching me the best techniques for me to pass my grade 5 exam. I am still continuing my passion for my musical joureny and hope to see where it takes me in the future..... </p>
